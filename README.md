##Overview
Project 2 of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera class.  The resulting text file is the tidy data set of the UCI Machine Learning Repositoryâ€™s Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. The full explanation for the data set may be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#.


##Project Summary
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Process
You can find additional information about the project in the CodeBook.MD file.
